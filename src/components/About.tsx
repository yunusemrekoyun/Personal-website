          I develop complete web applications from scratch, mainly using the
          MERN stack. My work spans from building RESTful APIs and backend logic
          to crafting responsive and intuitive user interfaces with React.

          On the frontend, I structure every part of the UI as independent,
          reusable components. This approach allows me to quickly transfer,
          scale, or customize features across projects without rewriting the
          logic â€” making development faster, cleaner, and more maintainable.

          I also design and develop mobile games using Unity. I focus on
          building lightweight, engaging mechanics with scalable systems and
          level structures tailored for casual gaming experiences on mobile
          platforms.

          I care deeply about clean architecture, performance optimization, and
          writing code that&apos;s both scalable and developer-friendly.
          I&apos;m currently seeking to bring this mindset into a professional
          environment where I can contribute to real-world products, collaborate
